TOPIC: CLASSIFYING PARALLEL SYSTEMS (FLYNN'S TAXONOMY)
--------------------------------------------------
1. SISD (Single Instruction, Single Data)
   - Standard sequential computer; one-on-one processing.

2. SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)
   - One command controls many processors.
   - Examples: Vector/Array processors and GPUs (CUDA Programming).

3. MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data)
   - Every processor works independently.
   - Shared Memory: All CPUs see one RAM (OpenMP).
   - Distributed Memory: Each CPU has private RAM; uses messages (MPI).

4. SUMMARY
   - SIMD = Classroom (One teacher, many students).
   - MIMD = Company (Many employees, many different roles).
