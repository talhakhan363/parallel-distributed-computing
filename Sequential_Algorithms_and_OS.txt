TOPIC: SEQUENTIAL LOGIC & THE OS ROLE
--------------------------------------------------
1. SEQUENTIAL ALGORITHMS
   - Definition: A step-by-step process where Step N+1 waits for Step N.
   - Bottleneck: Only utilizes 1 CPU core; others remain idle.

2. OPERATING SYSTEM (OS) AS MANAGER
   - Single Thread of Execution: Keeps track of one Program Counter (PC).
   - The Memory Wall: CPU is faster than RAM; sequential tasks spend 
     most time "waiting" for data.

3. KEY TAKEAWAY
   - Parallel and Distributed Computing aims to eliminate idle CPU time 
     by breaking the "One-Way Street" of sequential logic.
