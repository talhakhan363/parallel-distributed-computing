TOPIC: CONCURRENCY vs. PARALLELISM & CONTEXT SWITCHING
--------------------------------------------------
1. CONCURRENCY (Planning)
   - Managing multiple tasks by switching between them (interleaving).
   - "Juggling" analogy: One person handling three balls.

2. PARALLELISM (Executing)
   - Doing multiple tasks at the exact same microsecond.
   - Requires multiple physical cores/processors.

3. CONTEXT SWITCHING
   - The OS "Bookmark" process. 
   - Saves current state (PCB) to pause Task A and load Task B.
   - High Overhead: Too much switching slows down the system (Thrashing).
