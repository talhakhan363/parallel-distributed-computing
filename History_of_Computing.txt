TOPIC: THE EVOLUTION OF PERFORMANCE
--------------------------------------------------
1. THE SEQUENTIAL ERA (1940s - 2004)
   - Based on Von Neumann Architecture (SISD).
   - Performance improved via "Frequency Scaling" (increasing GHz).
   - Moore’s Law: Transistors doubled every 2 years.

2. THE POWER WALL (Circa 2004)
   - Physical Limit: Increasing clock speed created unmanageable heat.
   - Result: Shift from making one core "faster" to adding "more" cores.

3. THE MODERN PIVOT
   - Transition from Sequential Scaling to Parallel Scaling.
   - Software must now be written to use multiple cores/nodes simultaneously.
