# Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC)
**Course Repository | BSCS 611 & BSSE 601**

## 📖 About the Course
This repository contains study materials, lecture notes, and lab implementations for the Parallel and Distributed Computing course.

As modern computing shifts away from single-core performance increases (the end of the "Free Lunch"), this course explores how to design, analyze, and implement algorithms that leverage multiple processors, GPUs, and distributed clusters.

## 🛠️ Core Technology Stack
The course transitions from low-level system calls to high-level parallel APIs:
* **Operating Systems:** Linux/UNIX environments and Shell scripting.
* **Shared Memory Programming:** Multithreading with POSIX threads and **OpenMP**.
* **Distributed Memory Programming:** Cluster computing using **MPI** (Message Passing Interface).
* **Heterogeneous Computing:** General-Purpose GPU programming with **NVIDIA CUDA (C/Python)**.

## 📂 Repository Structure (Planned)
This repository is organized following the 15-week course plan:

1. **Foundations:** History, Flynn’s Taxonomy, and RISC/CISC Architectures.
2. **OS & Concurrency:** System APIs (`fork`), Multithreading, and Synchronization (Mutex/Semaphores).
3. **PRAM Models:** Theoretical analysis of Parallel Random Access Machines (EREW, CREW, CRCW).
4. **Distributed Systems:** Sockets, Data Replication, and Election Algorithms.
5. **Applied Parallelism:** Practical implementations in OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI.

## 📝 Lab Requirements & Policies
* **Hardware:** Core i5+ with Hardware Virtualization support and 4GB+ RAM.
* **Software:** VMWare for Linux virtualization, Google Colab/Kaggle for GPU access.
